Architecture Overview: PetOS

1. High-Level Concept

PetOS is a Single Page Application (SPA) built on React. It simulates a mobile app experience ("App-like website"). It relies on a component-based architecture with a focus on immediate UI feedback.

2. Technical Stack

Frontend Core: React 18+

Build Tool: Vite (Fast HMR, optimized build).

Language: JavaScript (ES6+) or TypeScript (Recommended for strict typing).

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first).

Icons: Lucide React (Lightweight, consistent SVG icons).

Animations: CSS Transitions + Tailwind animate- classes.

3. Data Flow (Architecture)

MVP Phase (Current):

State: Local React State (useState) lifted to specific Page components.

Persistence: localStorage (to save state between reloads in browser).

Mock Data: Hardcoded JSON objects for rapid prototyping.

Production Phase (Target):

Backend: Firebase (Google).

Auth: Firebase Authentication (Family accounts).

DB: Cloud Firestore (Real-time updates for tasks/status).

Storage: Firebase Storage (Photos of docs/receipts).

State Management: React Context API (for UserAuth and PetGlobalData).

/src
  /assets        # Static images/fonts
  /components    
    /ui          # Atomic components (Card, Button, Input)
    /widgets     # Complex blocks (HappinessWidget, WalkTimer)
    /modals      # Overlays (QuickActionMenu)
  /hooks         # useWalkTimer, useHappinessIndex
  /pages         # Dashboard, Health, Travel, Family
  /styles        # Global CSS / Tailwind directives
  /utils         # Helpers (date formatting, math)


5. Key Algorithms

Smart Weight Calculation: (Weight_With_Pet - Weight_Human) = Pet_Weight.

Happiness Index: Decaying value over time, boosted by user interactions (Logarithmic scale).

Travel Timeline: Reverse calculation from Departure_Date based on Rule_Set (e.g., Titer test = Date - 90 days).
