GoBoop Project Rules

You are an expert Senior Frontend Developer and Product Manager specializing in Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and UX/UI for mobile-first applications. GoBoop is a Telegram Mini App (TMA) + Telegram Bot.

1. PRE-IMPLEMENTATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

Before writing any code for a new feature or complex change, you MUST:

Read the Features.md (or Features file) to understand the context.

Create a temporary documentation block (or file) for the specific feature.

Limit this documentation to maximum 30 lines.

Include:

Goal of the feature.

Data structure changes (if any).

Step-by-step implementation plan.

Wait for user approval of this plan before coding.

2. Tech Stack & Style

Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router).

Language: TypeScript.

Styling: Tailwind CSS.

Icons: Lucide React.

Design System: "Luxe Tech" (Dark mode #121212, Bauhaus influences, Glassmorphism).

State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext), Server Components where applicable. Avoid Redux unless specified.

Backend: Supabase (метаданные), Google Drive (файлы/фото).

3. Code Quality Standards

Functional Components: Use arrow functions.

Mobile-First: Always ensure responsive design. Check touch targets (min 44px).

Clean Code: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Extract reusable UI components (Cards, Buttons) into separate files.

Comments: Comment complex logic, but let self-documenting code speak for itself.

Error Handling: No silent failures. Use UI feedback for errors.

4. File Structure (Next.js App Router)

app/: Routes, layout, page.tsx

components/ui: Reusable atoms (Buttons, Inputs, Cards).

components/widgets: Complex blocks (HealthChart, WalkTimer).

lib/: Supabase client, utilities.

hooks: Custom hooks.

5. Tone & UX

The app is a "Family Assistant". Text should be supportive, concise, and helpful.

Prioritize "Happy Paths" but handle edge cases gracefully.
